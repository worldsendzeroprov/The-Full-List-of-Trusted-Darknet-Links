# Darknet - Market Wiki

Welcome to the **Darknet - Market Wiki**, your comprehensive guide to navigating and utilizing the various markets available on the darknet. Whether you're a buyer, seller, or simply looking to explore, this wiki will provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to securely engage with these platforms. The information covers everything from creating secure accounts to safely completing transactions, and everything in between.

## Market Overview

Darknet markets have become essential platforms for conducting anonymous transactions, allowing buyers and vendors to trade goods and services in a secure, private environment. These markets are typically accessed via Tor, a network that ensures anonymity by routing traffic through a series of encrypted layers. Most darknet markets accept cryptocurrency payments, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) being the most popular options due to their enhanced privacy features.

### Key Features of Darknet Markets
- **Cryptocurrency Payments:** Markets typically support Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR), with Monero being preferred for its privacy features.
- **Onion Links & Mirror Sites:** Secure access to markets is provided through onion links and mirrors, which protect against downtime and ensure continued access.
- **Escrow Systems:** These markets often utilize an escrow system, holding funds securely until the buyer confirms receipt of the product, minimizing fraud.
- **PGP & 2FA:** Markets often implement PGP encryption for secure communication and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added account security.

## How to Register on a Darknet Market

Creating an account on a darknet market is the first step to start buying or selling. The process is similar across most platforms but varies slightly depending on the market.

### Registration Steps:
1. **Access the Onion URL**: Visit the official onion URL or a verified mirror link through the Tor Browser.
2. **Create a Username & Strong Password**: Choose a unique username and strong password to protect your account.
3. **Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Most markets require you to set up a 6-digit PIN as an extra layer of protection.
4. **PGP Public Key**: For encrypted communications, you’ll need to provide a PGP public key.
5. **Account Recovery**: After registration, you will receive a mnemonic recovery phrase—store it securely to recover your account in case of a password loss.

## How to Log In

Logging into a darknet market account is generally straightforward, but it's crucial to always verify you're on the correct website to avoid phishing attempts.

### Login Process:
1. **Enter Credentials**: Input your username and password.
2. **Verify Onion URL**: Always ensure that you’re using the market’s verified onion URL or a trusted mirror link.


## How to Buy

Purchasing items on a darknet market is secure, but it requires careful attention to detail to ensure a smooth transaction.

### Steps to Make a Purchase:
1. **Browse Listings**: Explore categories like drugs, digital services, or other illicit goods.
2. **Choose a Product**: Select the item you wish to purchase and proceed to checkout.
3. **Payment**: Pay using either Bitcoin (BTC) or Monero (XMR). Monero is often preferred for its privacy benefits.
4. **Escrow Protection**: Once payment is made, the market’s escrow system holds your funds until the product is confirmed to be delivered.

## Security Tips

Security is a critical aspect of using darknet markets. Follow these tips to protect yourself from scams and hacking attempts.

### Key Security Practices:
- **Use VPN & Tor**: Always browse using the Tor browser and a VPN for enhanced anonymity.
- **Enable 2FA & PGP**: Utilize Two-Factor Authentication and PGP encryption to secure your account and communications.
- **Verify URLs**: Double-check that you are on the correct onion link to avoid phishing sites.
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Choose unique, complex passwords for your accounts.
- **Avoid External Platforms**: Never use third-party platforms (e.g., Telegram) to bypass escrow or market rules.

## Buyer Guidelines

As a buyer, it’s essential to ensure the vendor is trustworthy before making a purchase. Here’s how to protect yourself during the buying process:

### Buyer Safety Tips:
- **Check Vendor Ratings**: Always review vendor feedback and ratings before making a purchase.
- **Use Escrow**: Ensure the transaction is processed through the escrow system to avoid fraud.
- **PGP Encryption**: Use PGP encryption for sensitive communications, such as sharing shipping addresses.
- **Avoid Finalize Early (FE)**: Never agree to finalize early, as this bypasses the escrow system and increases the risk of fraud.


## Escrow System

Most darknet markets implement an escrow system to protect both buyers and sellers.

### How Escrow Works:
1. **Funds Held in Escrow**: When a buyer makes a payment, the funds are held by the market until the buyer confirms receipt of the product.
2. **Release of Funds**: The funds are only released to the vendor once the buyer confirms satisfaction with the transaction.
3. **Protection for Both Parties**: The escrow system reduces the risk of fraud, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations before funds are exchanged.
